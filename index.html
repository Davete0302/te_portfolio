                                Flutter.
                                As the only mobile developer, my responsibilities range from creating the project
                                architecture,participating in project design, adding new features, API integration,
                                debugging, maintenance, and deploying the app.
                                I am involved in creating projects for iOS, Android, and Windows. These projects include
                                a tablet POS with Bluetooth printing, a Kiosk for Windows, and an ERP system for iOS and
                                Android.
                                Additionally, I had to ensure that the app was scalable and maintainable. I was also in
                                charge of creating the local database, which was used to store
                                the data locally to be synced to a cloud database later on. To build these applications
                                I used the Flutter framework together with Provider as the state management and sqlite
                                for the local database.

                                As a developer, I was responsible for modifying, debugging, and adding new features to
                                an existing and/or new project.
                                My tasks also include API integration and providing time and effort estimates. Working
                                closely with the designer, backend developer, and project manager.
                                During my tenure here, I have used React Native Expo and Flutter to build hybrid
                                applications, which involve iOS, Android, and Web. I had to make sure that the
                                application works on the web as it does on
                                mobile with the same codebase and minimal alterations to the existing functions.
                                My experience here covers front-end development with React Native and Flutter. For React
                                Native, I utilized Mobx for state management and TypScript.
                                For Flutter, I've used Rxdart for state management and one signal for push notification.

                                I also had to troubleshoot any issues that arose and ensure that the application was
